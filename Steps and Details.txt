1. Create your Model. 
	In my case for simplicity I have created Boston Hosuing Price Model.

2. Download the Python Notebook and Model created.

3. Create a new Git Repo for End-To-End-ML-Prj
	https://github.com/mayanktripathi4u/End-To-End-ML-Prj
	Set the gitignore; git template as Python and Licence as Apache. Include README.
	
4. Now get this on to local... using 
	git clone https://github.com/mayanktripathi4u/End-To-End-ML-Prj.git
	
5. Open the Project in VS-Code, which we will be using it for all commits from local.
